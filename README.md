# Classification: Credit Card Approval Prediction

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, I'm building an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

# Data Set: 
  The Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
  -> https://bit.ly/39gmhUa

# Data Processing Workflow:
- Data Inspection
- Data Validation
- Missing value imputation
- Numerical and Categorical data
- Encoding

# Machine Learning:
- Train Test split of data
- Label encoding
- Feature scaling
- Logistics Regression model
- Preformance analysis: Confusion matrix
- Model tuning: GridSearchCV
	
Thank you.
